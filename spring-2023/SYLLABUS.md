# SYLLABUS

## Targeted Students
- Middle school or higher students due to lecture difficulty
- Students who can bring a laptop (highly recommended) or Chromebook to write a programming code

## Lecture Meeting Times
- Lectures: 1 session / week for 10 times during the semester, 1 hour / session

## Lecture Goals & Description
- This course is an introduction to software engineering, using the Javaâ„¢ programming language. Students will learn the fundamentals of Java. The focus is on getting familiar with basic syntax and OOP(Object Oriented Programming) concept.

- The course is designed for students with non-programming experience, but if you have, you will do fine. Each class is composed of one hour of lecture including a pop quiz.

- The course doesn't cover Data Structure and Algorithm

## Lecture topics
- Week 1: Orientation & Why Java?
- Week 2: Primitive Types, Variables
- Week 3: Operators, More types, Methods
- Week 4: Conditionals
- Week 5: Loops
- Week 6: Arrays
- Week 7: Objects and classes
- Week 8: Access control, class scope, packages
- Week 9: Inheritance
- Week 10: TBA

## Editors (IDE, Integrated Development Environments)
- Most professional Java developers use an integrated development environment (IDE), which combines a source code editor with other tools for software development. They make it easy to find and correct errors, and to accomplish tasks through a graphical interface, instead of the command line. In this class, we recommend using [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/).
